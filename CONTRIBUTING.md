# Contributing to end-credits-gen

Welcome and thanks for willing to help.

Please, follow these rules:

- start with forking this repo to your profile
- use common sense
- write meaningful commits, great source to follow: https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/
- I use gitmojis at the beginning of a commit message, I'd love if you use them too: https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/
- always relate a commit to issue number, if there is one, simply add #123
  - example message: `âœ¨ #17 Add support for images`
- at the end create a Pull Request, description with explanation why and what is this change about, are welcome, screenshot too
